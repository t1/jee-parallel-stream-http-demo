= Jakarta EE Parallel Stream Http Demo

This is a little demo to show how to use a parallel stream of managed threads doing http requests.

It has two REST resources:

|===
|URL |Result

|http://localhost:8080/\{n}plus\{m}
|the sum of `n` and `m`

|http://localhost:8080/sum
|the sum of a stream of 1 and 2, adding 1 to every element => 5
|===

The `sum` resource does two parallel http requests to the `plus` resource, using a proper https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency/3.0/jakarta-concurrency-spec-3.0.html#managedthreadfactory[Managed Thread Factory].

At least, this is how I understand the Spec; esp. the Javadoc of the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency/3.0/apidocs/jakarta/enterprise/concurrent/managedthreadfactory[ManagedThreadFactory] class.

*Please correct me if I'm wrong!*
